# Actor backlog

The Builder routine takes the first item under **Approved** that has no open PR, builds it, and moves it to **Built**.
The Niche Scout routine adds scored ideas under **Proposed** every Monday. To approve one, move it under **Approved**
(edit this file on GitHub or tell Claude in the project chat).

Rules for every idea: public data only, no logins, no personal data, no bypassing a site's bot blocking or terms.
